- **Platform**: E-Trade or TD Ameritrade
- **Position Size**: $100-$500 per stock

## 🛡️ **Risk Management for Real Money**

### **Never Risk More Than You Can Afford to Lose**
- Start with money you can completely lose
- Don't use emergency funds or retirement savings
- Consider it "tuition" for learning algorithmic trading

### **Position Sizing Rules**
- **Maximum 2% risk per trade**: If you have $10K, risk max $200 per trade
- **Maximum 10% in any single stock**: Diversification is key
- **Maximum 25% in any single strategy**: Don't put all eggs in one basket

### **Account Structure Recommendations**
```

## 🚨 **What You Should Be Aware Of Before Big Money**

### **Common Pitfalls That Lose Money**:

1. **Over-Optimization**: Strategy works perfectly on historical data but fails in real trading
2. **Insufficient Testing**: Not enough time in paper/small money testing
3. **Ignoring Transaction Costs**: Commissions and slippage eat profits
4. **Emotional Override**: Manually interfering with algorithm decisions
5. **Position Size Too Large**: One bad trade wipes out months of gains

### **Red Flags to Watch For**:
- Strategy only works in trending markets
- Win rate drops significantly with real money
- Unable to explain why a trade was made
- Changing strategy parameters frequently
- Revenge trading after losses

## 📈 **Interactive Brokers Setup (Recommended)**

Since you're serious about algorithmic trading, here's how to set up IBKR:

### **Account Setup**:
1. Open IBKR Pro account (lower costs for active trading)
2. Fund account with $2,000+ (for day trading margin)
3. Apply for options, margin permissions as needed
4. Download TWS (Trader Workstation)

### **API Setup**:
1. Enable API in TWS settings
2. Install `ib_insync` Python library
3. Connect your bot to IBKR instead of E-Trade
4. Test with paper trading account first

### **Cost Structure**:
- **Stocks**: $0.005/share, $1.00 minimum
- **Options**: $0.70 per contract
- **Market Data**: $1-25/month depending on exchanges
- **No account minimums** for cash accounts
